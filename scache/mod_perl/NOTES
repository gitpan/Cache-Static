INSTALLATION:

#first, edit the following two lines in scache.pm to reflect your setup:
my $VERBOSITY = 1; #2=visible messages, 1=html comments, 0=none
my $BACKEND = "http://localhost:80/mason";
my $SCACHE_ROOT = "/scache";

#then copy scache.pm to someplace in your perl include path, e.g.:
sudo cp scache.pm /www-perl/Apache/scache.pm

#then change httpd.conf (make sure the location corresponds to $SCACHE_ROOT)
<Location /scache>
    SetHandler perl-script
    PerlHandler Apache::scache
</Location>

CAVEATS:
the verboseness probably won't do exactly what you want...
	it must return whatever your backend call has when (re)generating
	but you have to specify here when serving a cached component
